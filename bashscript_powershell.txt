
In my machine the location is D:\AlgoDat\Exercises\A02

And the name of my java file is MyHeapSortJavaImplementation.java

So bash script for running in PowerShell CommandPrompt will be as follows:

d:
cd D:\AlgoDat\Exercises\A02
javac MyHeapSortJavaImplementation.java   //Compiling
java MyHeapSortJavaImplementation         //Running

                                          //Display of my result
